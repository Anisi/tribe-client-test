# Motivation

My idea was to start a project based on Tribe facilities to have different challenges and be different from Tribe's default implementation.

I had many choices, but I chose Instagram because I thought a media-based social network would make those challenges. On the other hand, It's popular, and the features and challenges are almost recognized.
