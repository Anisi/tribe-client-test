# Motivation

I wanted to start a project base on Tribe facilities to have different challenges and be different from Tribe's default implementation.

I had many choices, but I chose Instagram because I thought a media-based social network would make those challenges. On the other hand, It's popular, and the features and challenges are almost recognized.

# Dependencies

Created with create-react-app v5.0.1

All other dependencies are listed in [package.json](package.json).

# Suggestions

I think if all Tribe entities had meta-field out of the box, It would have helped the clients to be more innovative and easy to implement their ideas. I realized that post types are included in the system core but I couldn't find a way to add a new one or add met-field to existed ones.

# Resolutions

1. Improving queries
2. Writing automated tests
3. Improving Responsibility and (adding more breakpoints, PWA, skeleton loader, etc.)
4. Complete the project to cover with Instagram features more.
5. Replace customized features with the meta-field app.
6. Improving the site content for screen-readers.
7. Handling posts and stories with custom post types.
8. Adding user post suggestion depending on posts that user sees regularly.
9. Making page meta fields dynamic (react-helmet).
10. Creating a docker-compose file for deployment.
